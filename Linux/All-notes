Regular Expressions
[a-z]

[a-z]{6,10]
  - From A to z from the characters that has 6 characters and then if it reach 10 characters then it highlights or chooses that.
[^abc]
  - anything aside a,b and c.
^ 
  - start of the string
$
  - end of the string
[A-z0-9]+.(jpg|png|bmp|svg)

9/7/2024
history 
   - shows all history of commands executed.
!-n
- executes the nTH command from the bottom of the history list
date
- shows the date today
cal 8 2025
- shows the 8th month (august) and the corresponding days in 2025.
!!
- executes the most recent command
!cal
- execute the most recent iteration of a specific command (for example cal 8 2025 was called earlier, so it will execute that automatically).

Local variables
- exists only in the shell/terminal, if closed all variables get deleted.
example
variable1='Something'
The echo command is used to display output in the terminal. 
To display the value of the variable, use a dollar sign $ character followed by the variable name as an argument to the echo command:
echo $variable1 
- this would output Something

The type command can be used to determine information about command type.
- type command
- internal commands
  - builtin commands in the shell itself.
- external commands
  - The which command searches for the location of a command by searching the PATH variable.
  - which nano
    - output should be where the nano command is

alias
- make longer commands shorter
- example: ls -l is shorted with ll or l

Functions
you can also create functions
- more advanced thn the alias
function_name () 
{
   commands
}
- used to execute a set of commands at once

Quoting
glob charcters
- wildcards
- *, ?, []
- double quotes 
  - asterisk is just an asterisk, a question mark is just a question mark, and so on, which is useful when you want to display something on the screen that is normally a special character to the shell.
  - Double quotes still allow for command substitution, variable substitution, and permit some other shell metacharacters
- single quotes
  - prevent the shell from doing any interpreting of special characters, including globs, variables, command substitution and other metacharacters
  - For example, to make the $ character simply mean a $, rather than it acting as an indicator to the shell to look for the value of a variable, execute the second command displayed below:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo The car costs $100                           
The car costs 00                                                        
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo 'The car costs $100'                        
The car costs $100
- Backlash
  - doubleqoutes, $1 and $PATH are considered as variables which means placing them in a double qoutes would execeute them
  - inside a single quote, they are not considered as variables so they just printout the way they are.
  - say you want $PATH treated as a virable and $1 not. You can use a \ or backslash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo The service costs \$1 and the path is $PATH
The service costs $1 and the path is /usr/bin/custom:/home/sysadmin/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

backquotes
- used to specify a command within a commnd called command subsitution
- say u want to display date
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is date                               
Today is date
- with the use of backquotes:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ echo Today is `date`                         
Today is Mon Nov 4 03:40:04 UTC 2018

Control statements
semicolon
- used to run multiple commands one after the other.
- cal 1 2023; cal 2 2023; cal 3 2023 would display those 3 months in their respective years.
double ampersand 
- command1 && command2
- logical and if first command successful then second should
- if first does not run then also the second
double pipe
- command1 || command2
- if first command runs successfully, second command is skipped
- if first command fails then the second command is run.
- either run this first command or run the second one.
